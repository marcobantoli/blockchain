# Blockchain in Python 🧱

This project demonstrates a simple blockchain implementation using Python. It includes features such as Proof of Work (PoW), transactions, and mining rewards.

---

## Features 🚀

- **Blockchain Structure:** Implements a basic blockchain with blocks containing transaction data.
- **Proof of Work (PoW):** Secures the blockchain by requiring computational work to mine blocks.
- **Transactions:** Allows for value transfers between parties, including mining rewards.
- **Validation:** Ensures the integrity of the blockchain by verifying hashes and block links.
